# In this repo, I have uploaded the three source codes which indicates following context towards the task,

## - **In first file I have compared the efficiency of extracting the features and observed that in comparison with fully connected network the DeepLab pre-trained model has done sharp segmentation.**
## -In second file (segmented_Dlab.ipynb) I have just taken the foreground without the transparent screen.
## -In third file I have extracted the forground and put it with transparent screen background.
